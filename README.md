# Server Client Tests

For both, used a simple " $gcc {c file name} -o {executable name} " compile command.

Exploratory assignment into connections on both client-side and server-side C programs. Played around listening to a specific port on both a blocking and non-blocking socket options, although there was a few hiccups on the non-blocking portion as sometimes the server-side operations would not act in a non-blocking manner - so there is room to grow given that area. This form of networked communications is very interesting and the process of doing this through C is much more involved. CSCV revolves about using NSA security standard code in C and these type of socket programming are some of the things I think the course highlights well.
